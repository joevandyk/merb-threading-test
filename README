== THE PROBLEM

Since merb is threaded, you'd think that running slow actions alongside faster actions
wouldn't slow down the faster actions.  Since the slow ones are in their own thread.

And that's the case, when the slow actions are slow because you are doing a 'sleep' call
or something.  But if you are doing a network call inside the slow action, the fast 
actions don't run as quickly.  Is it because the network call is blocking the other 
threads in the merb process?

== Details of the test app

There's two actions, a slow one and a fast one.

The slow one loads slashdot.org and tells you how many bytes it is.  

The fast one returns some text. 

To test the fast one, you can run:
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:5000/fast

and to test the slow one:
ab -n 1000 -c 2 http://localhost:5000/slow

Assuming merb is started on port 5000.  I started merb with this:
merb -p 5000 -d -X off -e production
