9/5/2008:
* Language::English::Inflector is now English::Inflect - be sure to change your
  custom inflections in config/init.rb. Additionally, the merb-gen template 
  config/init.rb has been changed to document the features accordingly.

9/2/2008:
* AbstractController now uniformly uses instance_eval for Procs where previously
  the controller instance (self) was passed as an argument:
  - Procs thrown during dispatch 
  - Procs used as before/after filters
  - Procs used as conditions to before/after filters
  
  This means that code like this:
  
  proc { |c| c.a_controller_method }
  
  Becomes the following for the cases mentioned:
  
  proc { a_controller_method }

8/29/2008:
* The directory Merb.root / 'framework' is now gone - framework gems are
  expected to be installed as local gems in Merb.root / 'gems':
  sudo gem install merb -i ./gems
* The notion of a frozen application setup (using bundled gems) is now known
  as a bundled setup; Merb.frozen? => Merb.bundled? By default an app uses
  bundled gems (the -B or --bundle options to merb), to disable this use
  the option --no-bundle.

8/27/2008:
* Merb::Request#protocol now returns valid protocol names: http, not http://.

8/22/2008:
* controller.cookies['foo'] = { ... } (Hash with options) is now deprecated;
  use controller.cookies['foo'] = 'bar' for simple cookies without options, or
  use controller.cookies.set_cookie('foo', 'bar', options) for more control.

8/21/2008:
* Memcached sessions are now configured by assignment to 
  Merb::MemcachedSession.store (previously the CACHE constant was used)
* Added Merb::Config[:ignore_tampered_cookies] option to skip cookie warnings   
  during development. This defaults to 'on' in the development environment.
* Merb::Config[:session_store] or Merb::Config[:session_stores] now accept an
  Array (or String); when an Array is given, multiple session stores will be
  available to the application.
* If you have custom session stores (that inherit from Merb::SessionContainer)
  be sure to require them in your init.rb

8/20/2008:
* Merb::Config[:session_cookie_domain] is now     
  Merb::Config[:default_cookie_domain]
* Merb.registered_session_types is now Merb::Request.registered_session_types
* When running in :development env, cookie-based sessions won't bother you 
  by raising TamperedWithCookie anymore.

8/14/2008:
*  Merb.orm_generator_scope and friends are renamed.
** Merb.orm_generator_scope => Merb.orm
** Merb.test_framework_generator_scope => Merb.test_framework
** Added Merb.template_engine

Merb-gen is updated accordingly. This let us add --haml and similar
options to merb-gen and plugin generators.

8/10/2008:
* Modified the way Exceptions are handled in the Dispatcher
** To rescue all exceptions, supply Exceptions#exception
** To rescue all Merb-generated exceptions, supply Exceptions#base
** Exceptions#internal_server_error is no longer a catch-all and should
   not be used as such.

6/22/2008:

Erubis modified:
* <%= %> now can take a block, so <%= helper do %>Hello<% end %> now works
* Erubis buffer is now an ivar (@_erb_buf), which eliminates the need for
  eval in capture helpers.
  
CONSEQUENCE:
Helpers that take a block should simply return a string, and should not
use concat. Example:
  
  def my_helper(&blk)
    "My helper says #{capture(&blk)}."
  end
